# Getting Started with App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Typescript is added and custom tsconfig.
The goal of the application is to have a CV on the web.
The content was added more or less without meaning, but it will be refactored in the future.
For now, the application is intended for the web, but a mobile version will arrive in a few days.
The application is made completely without a backend, only the client side.

@TODO, Contact-form will be added
https://www.emailjs.com/ will be used as emailservice and implemented via https://www.npmjs.com/package/emailjs.
